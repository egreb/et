# ET - Easy Tree

> A clone for the tree utility written in go

## Usage

```
# without levels
et /example-directory

# with levels
et /example-directory 1
```

## TODO

- [x] List given directory as a tree
- [x] Query param to determine folder level to print
- [ ] Respect .gitignore if it exists - should be overwritable
